# Ping-Pong-Simulator
This project is a classic Pong arcade game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game allows two players to control paddles on either side of the screen and hit a ball back and forth. The game keeps track of the score for each player and displays it on the screen. The ball speed has been significantly increased to make the game more challenging and engaging.
